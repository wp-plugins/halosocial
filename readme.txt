== Frequently Asked Questions ==


== Will HaloSocial enable me to create a social network just like Facebook? == 
 
Pretty much. Most of Facebook’s features are also on HaloSocial, including news streams, profiles, events, groups and pages. But HaloSocial also has a number of very useful features that Facebook is missing, such as stores and classified ads. So your platform will be like Facebook… but better.
 
== What are the system requirements for HaloSocial? ==
 
Please visit [this article](http://www.halo.social/requirements "HaloSocia Requirements") for a full description of HaloSocial’s system requirements.
 
== Will HaloSocial work with my theme? ==
 
HaloSocial was tested with over a hundred of the most popular WordPress themes. You can find a full list of 
[HaloSocial compatible themes here](http://www.halo.social/supported-themes "HaloSocial compatible themes"). If you do find a compatibility issue with your theme, please post a support request on our forum. We’ll try to sort it out for you.
 
== How many users can HaloSocial support? ==

HaloSocial does not impose any limit on the number of users that can register on your site. In theory, you could register as many users as Wordpress can store into the database. So that’s a lot. In practice, the limits will depend on the hosting infrastructure and the servers the site is hosted on.
